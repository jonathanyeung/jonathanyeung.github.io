<p>I was very surprised that I could make it through a 90 minute class that was spoken almost entirely in Mandarin. I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. </p>
<p>However, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons. </p>
