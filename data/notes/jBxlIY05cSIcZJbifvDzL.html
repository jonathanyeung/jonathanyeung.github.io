<h3 id="pictographic">Pictographic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pictographic"></a></h3>
<p>The character originated as a picture of an actual object., such as 日 or 羊, which are pictures of the sun and a goat, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="indicative">Indicative<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#indicative"></a></h3>
<p>There are two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is a character that is an arbitrary creation used to depict an abstract concept, such as 上 (above) and 下 (below) or 一, 二, 三.</li>
<li>The second type uses a combination of a picture and indicator mark to point to the area being defined, such as 本(root)，which is a picture of a tree with an indicator marking the area where the root is.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="associative-compound">Associative Compound<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#associative-compound"></a></h3>
<p>The character is composed of two or more components which together convey the desired meaning, such as 坐 (sit) which is composed of two people 人 sitting above the ground 土.</p>
<h3 id="pictophonetic">Pictophonetic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pictophonetic"></a></h3>
<p>The character is composed of at least two components and one of them provide an indication of the pronunciation while the rest provide an indication of the meaning, such as 按 (to push), where the 安 component indicates that the character is pronounced like "an" but its meaning has something to do with the hand 扌.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#other"></a></h3>
<p>Infrequently encountered:</p>
<h4 id="mutually-explanatory">Mutually Explanatory<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mutually-explanatory"></a></h4>
<p>This category is rarely used because there is no consensus as to what characters belong here as the author of the term did not clearly define it.</p>
<h4 id="phonetic-loan">Phonetic Loan<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#phonetic-loan"></a></h4>
<p>The character originally had a completely unrelated meaning but because there weren't enough characters at the dawn of writing, scribes borrowed other characters that had the same pronunciation. In many cases, the character's original meaning is no longer associated with the character or has been lost or the original meaning is now expressed by a modification of the original character. For example, the character 因 (as in 因爲） currently meaning "cause" is a phonetic loan as the character originally indicated some form of mattress. Since 因 took on this new meaning, the original meaning is now expressed by 茵, where the 艹 grass radical is used to re-clarify that the character is about a grass mattress. These re-clarified characters are identified in the YellowBridge dictionary as Pictophonetic-Re-clarified.</p>
