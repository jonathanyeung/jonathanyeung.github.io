背景分析：

在多数人眼里，工作，家庭，汽车，住房，这些都是我们生活中不可缺少的东西。当我们想要在人生道路上做出一些选择或改变时，却发现这些东西常常会影响我们的决定。

在中国，帆船运动现在还不是很普及。帆船的价钱很贵，个人购买帆船的请况还很少。然而，课文中迷上帆船的翟峰做出了一个勇敢的决定，包括翟峰的父母，所有人都觉得他，“疯了”。你是怎么看这件事情的呢？

Background analysis:

In the eyes of most people, work, family, car, housing, these are all indispensable things in our lives. When we want to make some choices or changes in our life path, we find that these things often influence our decisions.

In China, sailing is not very popular right now. The price of a sailboat is very expensive, and there are very few requests for an individual to buy a sailboat. However, Zhai Feng, who was obsessed with sailing in the text, made a brave decision, including Zhai Feng's parents, and everyone thought he was "crazy". What do you think about this?

1. 你有什么爱好吗？它给你的生活带来好处？Do you have any hobbies? Does it bring benefits to your life?
2. 你觉得应该怎么处理爱好和工作，家庭，生活的关系？举例说明。How do you think you should deal with hobbies, work, family, and life? Illustrate.
3. 如果你的爱好影响了你的正常生活，你会怎么办呢？What would you do if your hobby interfered with your normal life?

> 请以“如果我是翟峰”我会（不会）。。。“为题写一段话，尽量用上本课所学的生词，字叔不少于100字。 Please start with "If I were Zhai Feng", I would (wouldn't)... Write a paragraph for the topic, and try to use the new words learned in this lesson, no less than 100 words.

果我是翟峰，我不会这么做。

当然，我能理解为什么他不想一辈子做一个工作。如果他不想干活儿~~一会儿~~ （休息一点儿时间）或者去一个新地方住一段时间，我也支持这个意见。 

但是，对翟峰的打算来买一艘帆船，我觉得有几个问题：

首先，买帆船之前，他都完全没试过航行。有机会他们一开航就会发现其实他们不喜欢帆船。那怎么办？ 已经卖了房子和辞职了工作，他们不能~~回去~~h（回头）

~~然后~~（ci tsi)，如果他们要卖房子才能买帆船，对我来说他们不够钱来怎么做。

最后，我觉得住在海上对他们的孩子不好。她不能去学校读书，也没有朋友跟她玩儿。她百分之百不喜欢在(一）搜帆船上生活。

If I were Zhai Feng, I wouldn't do this.

Of course, I can understand why he doesn't want to do a job for the rest of his life. If he doesn't want to work for a while or go to a new place for a while, I support that.

However, regarding Zhai Feng's plan to buy a sailboat, I think there are several problems:

First of all, he had never tried sailing before buying a sailboat. Chances are, as soon as they set sail, they find out that they don't like sailing. So what to do? Having sold their house and quit their jobs, they can't go back.

And then, if they have to sell their house to buy a sailboat, for me they don't have enough money to do it.

In the end, I feel that living at sea is not good for their children. She couldn't go to school, and she didn't have any friends to play with. 100% she doesn't like to live on a schooner.
