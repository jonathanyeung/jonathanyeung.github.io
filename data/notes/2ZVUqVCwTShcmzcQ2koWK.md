## Pronunciation Tips

- Think of two letters as one sound together; for example: hǎo - think of pronouncing 'ao' together, not a + o as is often the case with English pronunciations.

- Differentiating between 'a' 'o' 'e' tones - only change the outside shape of your mouth keep the rest (tongue, throat) in the same position

- When going from words 'zhi', 'chi', 'shi', 're' - the tongue continues to go up on each tone, but not too high on the fourth one - 're' is not has high as an 'r' sound in English

- xīng qí **rì**

    To pronounce rì, don't use outside of the face muscles, unlike English 

- zi - ci - si 

- ji - qi - xi - also vary tongue positions, j is lowest, then q then x 

    Think about where the tongue position is on the bottom teeth. 

- Pronunciation of qìshí - don't put heavy emphasis on first tone; instead place it on the second tone (unlike with most English words).
