## Care Notes

Smaller than my hand - at least 1 squeeze of the hand water each day. **Includes small guys that aren't poking out of their pots yet!**

Anything bigger, check every other day whether the soil is dry. To check:

- Put finger and dig a bit of the soil
- Or lift the plant and see if it's much lighter

If it's light, then water quite a bit; otherwise no water.

Also, turn then a quarter.

Apollo and Turtle are excluded. 

Wall guys - spray every day. 

if you forgot to spray one day, then wash in the sink the following day.
