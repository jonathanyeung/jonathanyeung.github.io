<p>Smaller than my hand - at least 1 squeeze of the hand water each day. <strong>Includes small guys that aren't poking out of their pots yet!</strong></p>
<p>Anything bigger, check every other day whether the soil is dry. To check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put finger and dig a bit of the soil</li>
<li>Or lift the plant and see if it's much lighter</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's light, then water quite a bit; otherwise no water.</p>
<p>Also, turn then a quarter.</p>
<p>Apollo and Turtle are excluded. </p>
<p>Wall guys - spray every day. </p>
<p>if you forgot to spray one day, then wash in the sink the following day.</p>
