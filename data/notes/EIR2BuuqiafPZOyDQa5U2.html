<p>Today I took the Chinese driver's exam.  Fortunately, I passed - but not without a sweat.</p>
<p>I had applied for a Chinese driver's license a few weeks ago. Because I had a foreign driver's license, I could skip a driver's test and obtain a license with just a written exam. About a week before my exam, my girlfriend sent me an official app for exam preparation.  But remembering how easy the written driving exam was in America, I casually dismissed it, thinking it should be the same difficulty.</p>
<p>The evening before the exam, I downloaded the app. As I read about the actual exam, I learned that the exam takes 100 questions randomly out of a thousand question pool, and that one must answer ninety percent correctly to pass!</p>
<p>I started to go through the questions in the app, but by question 50, I was scoring around 60 percent.  I also hit a paywall and had to buy the full app to see the remaining 950 questions.  While more than half of the questions were intuitive, a lot of questions required memorization - either because of poor translations or nuanced traffic rules such as hand signals and penalties for violations.  I immediately bought the app and started to study non-stop to try to get through all of the questions.</p>
<p>The day of the exam, I was feeling relatively confident as I had been able to study all 1000 questions. The exam was administered on a computer, with maybe 20 other people also taking the exam in the same session.  I finished the exam with confidence, and I clicked the submission button. A message popped up on the screen in Chinese that I couldn't read, so I walked to the front of the room to talk to the proctor, as several others had already done. However, the proctor indicated that there was a problem, and told me to go back to my computer.  I couldn't understand what she was trying to tell me, so my immediate thought was that I had failed and that I should check my answers and resubmit (I had read online that on a given test day, you get two attempts to pass). I started to panic and began reviewing my answers.  However, I sought to clarify with the proctor what the issue was, and after some difficult conversations in broken Chinese, I understood that there was actually a problem with the system and she was telling me to wait a while before resubmitting the exam. </p>
<p>Finally, after most of the other exam takers had already finished and left the room, the submission attempt succeeded on the fifth try.  The screen showed that I had scored 98% - I passed!  The proctor congratulated me and sent me along to the collection window to finalize the paper work.</p>
<p>The final 'exam' of the day - I had to provide our home address so that they could send me my license in a few days. If my verbal Chinese is poor, my written Chinese is worse. I wrote down our address along with my information, the officer squinted at it for a bit before nodding and accepting it.  My girlfriend joked that the chance of my license arriving to the right place were slim - but fortunately, it arrived a few days later.</p>

<p>今天我考驾照。我通过了考试但是不容易。</p>
<p>几个礼拜之前我申请了中国驾照. 因为我有外国驾照，考笔试就行了。考试一个星期之前，我的女朋友给我一个APP来复习。因为我记得以前在美国考驾照很容易，所以我以为中国的考试也不难。</p>
<p>考试的前一天我打开了这个APP. 我发现中国的考试特别难！从一千个问题中挑一百个。要答对九十个。天啊！</p>
<p>我马上开始学习。但是我学完五十个问题以后，我只能答对三十个。此外，为了看剩下的问题，我必须买这个APP. 虽然一半的问题比较容易，但是还有很多的问题要背下来。我马上付钱买了APP,然后很努力学习。</p>
<p>考试前，因为我复习好了一千个问题，我很有信心。考试在电脑上做。有差不多二十个人跟我一起考试。考完我觉得应该能过，我交了卷。但是，监考人员跟我说有点问题，叫(让）我回去电脑前。我听不懂他的意思，所以我担心不够九十分。我正要改答案，又觉得可能是别的问题。我又问了一下，这次他告诉我其实是他们的电脑有点儿问题，请我等一等，然后再交卷。</p>
<p>十五分钟以后，别人差不多（都）考完了。监考人员叫我再试（试能不能）交卷。这次成功了，电脑告诉我得了九十八分！</p>
<p>今天第二个“测试”--我要写我家的地址为了寄驾照给我。我写的非常慢，但是写的很丑。我的女朋友笑我--她说驾照收不到了！</p>
