- M muo
- N ne
- F fuo

### Focus On

Less "R" Sound for the following; flatter more relaxed tongue. the 'zh', 'ch', and 'sh' pronunciations are longer than in English.  For example, Ellie has problems pronouncing "cheap", because she's used to having a long "h", chhheap. 
- zh - tip: pronounce it like the "ge" part of "judge".  Then add the "i" yīn 
- ch - tip: like the 2nd "ch" of "church". 
- sh

Even flatter tongue than the "+h" variants:
- z
- c
- s

### Problematic R

Keep the tongue flat and not curled.  Practice saying English words incorrectly like "rule", "room"

### More problems

- 你 - very short "n"

hat with two dots underneath the radical is a barn ( a place where animals live)
- 穿
