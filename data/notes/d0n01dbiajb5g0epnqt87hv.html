<p>The Covid situation in China changed rapidly in December of 2022. Zero Covid abruptly ended in December, which led to speculation that the policy around immigration quarantines would also change.</p>
<p>As I was in Hong Kong and looking to return to Beijing, I was paying close attention to any news of the removal of the 5+3 day quarantine policy. There were early rumors that the quarantine policy would end on January 8th, but when the Chinese government officially announced the end of the quarantine policy, airline tickets were getting bought up quickly. In the rush, the best ticket I could manage to get was for January 7th. The flights between Hong Kong and Beijing were still limited to 3 a week, and the only options were either the 7th or the 19th - I figured spending one day in a quarantine hotel wouldn't be so bad.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong airport felt lively when I arrived for my flight. Walking down into the departures felt like it used to - a sprawling array of counters with 'snake lines' of people waiting to check in their bags - it felt good to see. My flight was full. While not as busy as Hong Kong's, Beijing's airport was still a very different scene than when I had left 6 weeks prior. When I was beginning my trip, the Beijing International Airport only had three flights for that entire day. The departure boards didn't need to scroll. On the way back though, the signs were evident that the Covid checkpoints and testing booths were about to be taken down. One of the '大白‘ even wrote a big sign on a whiteboard saying '再见 - BGS (Beijing Airport Ground Services) 2019.12 - 2023.01.' For them, three years of working as Covid-specialized immigration staff were coming to an end.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I didn't need to quarantine at all. After a short bus trip to a quarantine hotel right next to the airport, we were asked to sign a quick paper with some contact information and were allowed to leave. Finally, the quarantine policy had come to an end.</p>

<p>2022 十二月中国的疫情变了很快。零新冠政策马上取消了，所以人才外国进去中国隔离也可能会快取消。</p>
<p>我去了香港，所以我都要买机票回北京。十二月底已经有人说可能会一月八号就放松。政府一说是真的，机票就即刻加价格。八号机票马上卖完了。那个时间每个星期才有三班机从香港去北京，所以我找机票的时候才有七号或者十九号。我觉得选七号比较好。如果要住一天宾馆不太差。</p>
<p>我起飞的时候，香港的机场很忙。进机场我的感觉是同疫情之前一样。看到这么多人使我很开心。我班机坐满位。北京的机场都越来越多人。我下香港的时，北京机场一天才有三班机。但是回来那次，他们已经准备恢复正常。又一个大白在白板上写了一个句子：‘再见-BGS。2019.12 - 2023.01‘。明天他们的三年专业工作就完了。</p>
<p>很幸运我不要隔离。我们出了一个隔离宾馆以后，他们让我们签署表单就放我们了。终于，隔离政策结束了。</p>
