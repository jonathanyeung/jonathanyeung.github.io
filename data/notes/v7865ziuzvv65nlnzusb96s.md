## Class Notes

### 往往 vs 常常/经常

- 常常 is closer to 'often' in meaning. 往往 is closer to 'usually'
- Both can be used as an adverb indicating a situation occurring repeatedly.
- 往往 can only be used to describe something that has already happened, not a hypothetical situation (i.e. I want to drink coffee often)
- 往往 usually specifies a condition related to the action being talked about, whereas 经常 has no such restriction
- 往往不 (negative condition) can be used, whereas 常常 typically is a positive thing, the subject is willing to do the action.
- In a sentence, 往往 often comes before 会.

Examples:

- 我往往会星期三去买咖啡
- 我往往不会在 KFC 吃早饭.
