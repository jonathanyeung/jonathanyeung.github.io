### Differences in words for restaurants / buildings

> fan guan(r) and cha guan(r) can have an r sound because they are more casual places and can sound 'cute'. But you cannot say tu shu guan(r) because that's a place for work. 

- zao cha guan(r) - Mandarin way to describe Cantonese cafe for early morning dian xin.

> In formal settings (like fancy restaurant, official dinner), you can add a yī jīa measure word in front of it. yi jia fan guan(r)

## Prepared Passage

Talk about landing at the airport and going through quarantine.

### English

Traveling right now is very strange due to the coronavirus situation. I had an interesting experience traveling from Hong Kong to Beijing. 

On the airplane, there were very few passengers - in fact, I think that the flight attendants outnumbered the passengers.  It's tough business for airline companies right now.

Arriving at the Beijing airport was very interesting. When we got off the plane, it was hard to tell that we were at an airport at all - it looked more like a hospital ward. All of the airport staff were dressed in protective gear from head to toe. They resembled doctors more than airline staff.

Afterward, we had to spend 21 days in mandatory quarantine at a hotel. Next time, I'll talk about my experiences in quarantine.


### PinYin

### Characters Attempt

现在旅行是很奇怪，因为世界有新冠病毒。 我从香港来北京的时候是一个很有意思的事情。 

我们坐飞机也很有意思 - 下机的时候， 我看不出来是一个机场航站楼 - 如此是医院。 机场工作人员都穿衣服（protective）。 看次来他们是医生， 不是机场工作人员。 

让后， 我们一定隔离二十一天在酒店。 下期我会写我隔离的故事。
