## Class Notes

### Different Ways to Combine Verbs

Several different ways to say that 'we had a quick chat':
1. wǒmen liáo yī liáo ｜  **verb + 一 + verb** (indicates action in the present)
1. liáo liáo ｜ **verb + verb**
1. liáo le liáo ｜ **verb + 了 + verb** (this one means it has already happened)
1. wǒmen liáo le yi huir

yi hui(r) - means a short time 

### gāng gāng (刚刚) vs gāng cái (刚才)

#### Example 句子

**gāng gāng** - the sentence cannot be finished, there must be an additional statement to follow (in example below, it's 'hen you yisi').

- gāng cái wǒmen liáo le liáo zhōng gǔo wénhuà.
- wǒmen gāng gāng liáo le zhong guo wen hua, hen you yisi.

Another difference is that gāng cái can be a longer interval - 20 mins or greater; whereas gāng gāng can be one to two minutes 

### kàn bà (看罢) vs kěnéng (可能)

kàn bà - similar to kěnéng, but lower probability (kěnéng maybe 30% possibility, whereas kàn bà is like 2%). Literally means 'let me have a look'.

different words indicate different levels of likelihood, example Ellie gave is how can she reply to a student asking "can I pass the HSK exam?"

- keyi (definitely)
- yīng gai keyi (should be able to)
- kěnéng (possibly)
- kàn bà (highly unlikely)

- lǔ yóu (you literally means swim) this may be shorter, 1-2 weeks
vocab
hui da - answer, as in answer a question.  if you ask 
da an - the answer.  hui da ni de da an 

### shǒu radical (手)

shou radical - this radical indicates the word involves an action where you use your hand to do something. It always has an object noun.

#### Example Words

- **pai 排** （wait in line)
