## English

A friend of Chen introduced me to his former colleague who runs a group that plays soccer every week.  I joined them a few times over the past couple of weeks. It's been over 3 years since I've actually played - it's been by far the longest period without playing since I first started playing as a little kid. I've had to take time off after a double ACL surgery. 

I've forgotten how much I love playing soccer. Of course my touch was abysmal and my whole body was sore the day after, but it was a big relief to be back on the field.

## 汉子

我的朋友介绍给我一个踢球的同事。他每星期组织一个足球队一起去朝阳玩儿。 上几个星期我跟了他们一起踢。 因为我的膝盖做了两次外科手术, 我三年都没踢过。其实,这是我从小到现在最长时间没踢。

我记得我非常喜欢踢球。虽然我踢了很渣也踢完我的脚和腿都很疼，但是我很高兴有机会再踢球。

_for laughs_

My friend introduced me to a colleague who plays football. He organizes a football team to go to Chaoyang every week. I played with them in the last few weeks. Because I had two surgical operations on my knee, I haven't kicked it in three years. In fact, this is the longest time I haven't played since I was a kid.

I remember I like playing football very much. **Although I was scumbag and my feet and legs hurt after the kick, I am very happy to have the opportunity to play again.**
