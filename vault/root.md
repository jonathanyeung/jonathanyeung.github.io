In this blog, I'll document my journey in trying to learn Chinese for the 2nd (3rd?) time.

Most of the notes will be from my classes, but in an effort to practice writing, I will also try to write some notes in Chinese about my experiences here in Beijing.

The grammar may be bad and the sentences simple - bear with me; but that's part of the learning experience!

谢谢
