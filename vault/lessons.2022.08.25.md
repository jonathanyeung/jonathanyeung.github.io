## Vocabulary

### 首先/其次

#### shǒu xiān - First of all

首 means head

#### 其次 qí cì - secondly

- 次 in this case means '2'. For example 次女 means second / younger daughter.
- 次 can also mean 'not that good' (because first is better than this)

You can use these phrases together when there are two things, i.e. 首先，。。。；其次，。。。

If there are more than 2 things, you can say 首先。。。其次。。。再次。。。最后。。。

### 聘 - 招聘，应聘 zhāo pìn, yīng pìn
