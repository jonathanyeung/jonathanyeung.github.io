## English

Last Sunday, it snowed. The forecast had warned of it, but I wasn't mentally prepared for it when I woke up in the morning to see that the courtyard filled with yellow leaves had turned white over night. 

Living in Hong Kong for the past three years has made me acclimated to tropical weather, and I've forgotten what cold weather is like. 

I had to take advantage of 11-11 “Singles Day" shopping discounts to buy a new jacket to face the winter.

## 汉子

上星期日下雪了。天气预报已经说会下雪，但是我还没有准备好。那个早上，我起床看窗外就看到花园里黄色的树叶已经变成一片白色。

因为之前我住在香港差不多三年，我习惯热的天气。我忘了冷天起怎么样。

我一定趁双十一打折**的时候**来买一件新的特别暖的羽绒服。

alternatively （more casual of) 我趁着。。。，but then don't use 的时候

Correction: #todo


verb + zai + di fang + zuo shenme;
move di fang forward, not after 'zuo shenme' (not wo chi fan zai jia. )

Related:

- s + time + zai + di fang + v + o
- time, s + zai + di fang + v + o
as opposed to English, which is typically
s + v + o + time + zai + di fang

_for laughs_

It snowed last Sunday. The weather forecast has said it will snow, but I am not ready yet. That morning, when I got up and looked out the window, I saw that the yellow leaves in the garden had turned white.

Because before I lived in Hong Kong for almost three years, I am used to the hot weather. I forgot how it was from cold weather.

I must take advantage of the discount on Double Eleven to buy a new and very warm down jacket.

## Vocabulary

- 趁 chèn - to use the opportunity to, take advantage of
