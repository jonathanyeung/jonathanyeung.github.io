## General Notes

### Different Ways to Combine Verbs

Several different ways to say that 'we had a quick chat':
1. wǒmen liáo yī liáo -> verb + yī + verb (present)
1. liáo liáo -> verb + verb
1. liáo le liáo -> verb le verb (this one means it has already happened)
1. wǒmen liáo le yi huir

yi hui(r) - means a short time 

### gāng gāng (刚刚) vs gāng cái (刚才)

#### Example 句子

- gāng cái wǒmen liáo le liáo zhōng gǔo wénhuà. 
- wǒmen gang gang liáo le zhong guo wen hua, hen you yisi.

**gāng gāng** - the sentence cannot be finished, there must be an additional statement to follow (here, it's hen you yisi).

another difference is that gang cai can be a longer interval - 20 mins or greater; whereas gang gang can be one to two minutes 

### kan ba 

kan ba - similar to ke neng, but lower probability (ke neng maybe 30%, where as kan ba is like 2%)

different words indicate different levels of likelihood, example Ellie gave is how can she reply to a student asking "can I pass the HSK exam?"

- keyi (definitely)
- yīng gai keyi (should be able to)
- kěnéng (possibly)
- kan ba (highly unlikely)

different words for travel

- lǔ xíng - (xing means longer travel, 1 month or more? not strict)
- lǔ yóu (you literally means swim) this may be shorter, 1-2 weeks
vocab
hui da - answer, as in answer a question.  if you ask 
da an - the answer.  hui da ni de da an 

### shǒu radical (手)

shou radical - this radical indicates the word involves an action where you  use your hand to do something. It always has an object noun. use zhao + something

#### Example Words

- **pai 排** （wait in line)
- **zhǎo 找** (find). The right part of the word is gē (戈), which means weapon. Ellie mentioned a story that in ancient times, zhao can mean to seek out someone to attack them or for revenge.
