## Class Notes

### 弄 nòng - do

similar to 做 - but colloquially, 弄 can imply that it was done through illegal or sketchy means.

我帮你弄两张票。 Wǒbāng nǐnòng liǎng zhāngpiào. - I'll help you get two tickets.  Maybe the tickets were obtained through other means (no necessarily unclean, but maybe).

弄得 can also have the same meaning as 让。
