## Class Notes

### le 了

le - represents that an action is finished. It can also be in the future: tomorrow after dinner, we go...

- 我吃饭了 - le indicates chi has finished
- 我学韩语了 - le indicates xue has finished

#### 了 can be in several places

1. 我昨天学汉语**了** | subject + verb + object + 了
1. 我昨天学**了**三个小时汉语 ｜ subject + verb + 了 + "time" + obj. 了 shouldn't  be at the end of the sentence when you have a word for time / how many / how much .
1. 我昨天学了汉语，我很累 (lèi, tired) | subject + verb + 了 + obj. + explanation

#### One 了 versus two 了 in a sentence

Q: 你学了多长时间汉语？ (Nǐ xuéle duō cháng shíjiān hànyǔ?)

A:
1. 我学了三年汉语，汉语不难。 (Wǒ xuéle sān nián hànyǔ, hànyǔ bù nán)
    
   > Only a single 了 is used here, which implies that I have stopped the action of 学

1. 我学了三年汉语了，我选继续学。 (Wǒ xuéle sān nián hànyǔle, wǒ xuǎn jìxù xué) _jìxù means continue_

    > We use two 了 here because the action continues (I continue to study). In this example, the first 了 modifies '学'. The second 了 modifies the entire phrase '学了三年汉语'

## Prepared Passage

### English

While living in Hong Kong, we enjoyed going to shopping malls - there were a lot of large ones nearby. They provided good places to walk around, had excellent restaurants, and had interesting shops to browse. Furthermore, to try to attract more customers, a lot of malls started to have interesting promotions and offer things beyond shopping such as seasonal events and ornate art installations.

I have found the malls in Bejing to be quite good as well. In particular, one mall in Shuang Jing that we live close to is SKP. We recently went in there and find the design and artwork to be very interesting, even more interesting than the shops!

在香港，我们喜欢去商场。我们的家附近有很多大商场。商场是方便和好玩儿 - 可以在好的饭馆吃饭，和在商店买东西。另外，为了找多顾客，商场公司经常打折，有时会有艺术装置。

我觉得北京的商场也很好。我们刚才去一个商场在我们的家附近叫‘SKP’。艺术装置在里面很有意思 - 艺术装置比商店，我觉得艺术装置更有意思！
