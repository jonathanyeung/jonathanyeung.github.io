## Class Notes

Difference between 经历 and 经验:

- 经历 jīnglì - experience (as in experienced an event)
    - 总而言之是很好的经历 zǒngéryánzhī shì hěnhǎode jīnglì - All in all a good experience
- 经验 jīngyàn - experience (as in possessing of skill/knowledge from past events)
    - 我想我们的中后卫需要更多的经验。Wǒxiǎng wǒmende zhōnghòuwèi xūyào gèngduōde jīngyàn. - I think our centre-backs need more experience.
