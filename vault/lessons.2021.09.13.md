## Lesson Notes

### Difference between bú gǔo, ke shi, dan shi

These words indicate differences in strength of the meaning. bu guo - 30%, ke shi 50%, dan shi 100%.  Example from Ellie - turning down someone for a date.  Dan shi is a definite no. 

### Object of zhǎo

the object of zhao must be something that is visible. zhǎo a person, zhǎo a dī fang.  But I cannot zhǎo a "zhōng wen ke"

## Thoughts

I was very surprised that I could make it through a 90 minute class that was spoken almost entirely in Mandarin. I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. 

However, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons.
