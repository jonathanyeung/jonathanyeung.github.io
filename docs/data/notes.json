They provided good places to walk around, had excellent restaurants, and had interesting shops to browse. Furthermore, to try to attract more customers, a lot of malls started to have interesting promotions and offer things beyond shopping such as seasonal events and ornate art installations.\n\nI have found the malls in Bejing to be quite good as well. In particular, one mall in Shuang Jing that we live close to is SKP. We recently went in there and find the design and artwork to be very interesting, even more interesting than the shops!\n\n### Pīn Yīn\n\nZài Xiāng Gāng, wǒmen xǐhuān qù shāng cháng.

It always has an object noun. use zhao + something\n\n#### Example Words\n\n- **pai 排** （wait in line)\n- **zhǎo 找** (find). The right part of the word is gē (戈), which means weapon. Ellie mentioned a story that in ancient times, zhao can mean to seek out someone to attack them or for revenge.\n- **cā 擦** （erase)\n- **tiao 挑** （pick）\n\n\n## Vocabulary\n\njiao - you use both hands; turn in homework. pay a bill. \n\n- jiao zuo ye \n- jiao peng you. means to make new friends "

      "body": "\n## Class Notes\n\n#### Differences in words for restaurants / buildings\n\n- fàn guǎn(r) (饭馆儿) - restaurant\n- cān tīng (餐厅)- smaller, can be a sub-part of a fan guan(r)\n- bīn guǎn (宾馆) - hotel\n- tú shū guǎn (图书馆) - library\n    - shou du tu shu guǎn - capital library.  Shou Du means capital (Beijing, DC)\n- you yong guǎn (游泳馆) - swimming pool\n- chá guǎn(r) (茶馆儿) - tea house\n- kè tīng (客厅) - living room.\n\n> fan guan(r) and cha guan(r) can have an r sound because they are more casual places and can sound 'cute'. But you cannot say tu shu guan(r) because that's a place for work. \n\n- zao cha guan(r) - Mandarin way to describe Cantonese cafe for early morning dian xin.\n\n> In formal settings (like fancy restaurant, official dinner), you can add a yī jīa measure word in front of it. yi jia fan guan(r)\n\nBreakdown of 馆 (guǎn) character:\n\nOn the right side, there's a roof over a character meaning 'government official' (goon in Cantonese). So it's a roof over where officials gather; a formal gathering place\n\n#### kè 客\n\nVery commonly used word. Same as in 不客气 （you're welcome)\n\n- gù kè (customer at a shopping store)\n    - gù means to look backward.  Need to look back several times in order to shop for something. \n- kè rén - customer at a restaurant; guest visiting your home\n- kè hù - customer at a bank (haak in Cantonese)\n\n#### Teacher (lao shi vs xian sheng)\n\nxian sheng is not used to mean liao shi anymore (old China word), unless that liao shi is very esteemed. Now it's mostly used for meaning \"sir\"; can also be used fo rhusband (more formal than lao gong)\n\n#### fǎn yì 反义\n\nthe opposite. For example, fǎn yì ci is the opposite word of something (shang vs xia)\n\n#### zì (字) vs cí (词)\n\nzi is one character, ci is usually compound characters (2+)\n\n#### miàn (面) vs bian (边)\n\nvery similar, bian means edge, mian is an open face.  li mian, li bian\n\n#### zuǒ (左) vs yòu (右) characters\n\nImportant characters to learn. \n左 has a 工 - because you 'typically work with your right hand'\n右 has a 口 - because you typically eat with your right hand\n\n\n后边 - hou bian; behind\n前边 - qian bian; in front\n\n\n\nalso learn characters for qian and hou bian \n\n\n### Additional Vocabulary\n\nCheckbox indicates note card made\n\n- [ ] zuo zi - table\n- [ ] zi xue - self study\n- [ ] liao tian(r) | shuo tianr means weather, because it means to do small talk (like talking about the weather)\n- [ ] yu san - umbrella\n- [ ] san oǔ ěr - occassionally\n- [ ] ya yi - emotion, feeling\n- [ ] da suan - planning | subject + da suan  + time + (place) + do something. place must be prefixed by zai or qu \n- [ ] da zhe - this clothes is too expensive, can you make it? \n- [ ] Zhou Mo (周末) - weekend\n\n_week of 20th no class on Monday and Tuesday._\n\n---\n\n## Prepared Passage\n\nTalk about landing at the airport and going through quarantine.\n\n### English\n\nTraveling right now is very strange due to the coronavirus situation. I had an interesting experience traveling from Hong Kong to Beijing. \n\nOn the airplane, there were very few passengers - in fact, I think that the flight attendants outnumbered the passengers.  It's tough business for airline companies right now.\n\nArriving at the Beijing airport was very interesting. When we got off the plane, it was hard to tell that we were at an airport at all - it looked more like a hospital ward. All of the airport staff were dressed in protective gear from head to toe. They resembled doctors more than airline staff.\n\nAfterward, we had to spend 21 days in mandatory quarantine at a hotel. Next time, I'll talk about my experiences in quarantine.\n\n\n### PinYin\n\nXianzai luxing(travel) shi hen qiguai, yin wei shi jie you xinguan bingdu (coronavirus). Wo cong Xiang Gang Lai Beijing de shi hou shi yi ge hen you yisi de shìqíng (event).  \n\nWomen zuo feiji you hen shao de chéngkè(passengers). Qi shi, wo cai kongcheng renyuan (flight attendents bi chengke duo. Wo xiang hangkong gongsi you hen da de wenti.\n\nZai Beijing jichang ye hen you yisi - Xia ji de shi hou, wo kan bu chu lai shi yi ge ji chang hang zhan lou (terminal) - ruci shi yi yuan.  ji chang  gong zuo ren yuan dou chuan (protective) yifu. Kan ci lai tamen shi yi sheng, bu shi ji chang gong zuo ren yuan.\n\nRanghou, women yiding geli  er shi yi tian zai jiu dian.  Xia qi wo hui xie wo geli de gu shi.\n\n### Characters Attempt\n\n现在旅行是很奇怪，因为世界有新冠病毒。 我从香港来北京的时候是一个很有意思的事情。 \n\n我们坐飞机也很有意思 - 下机的时候， 我看不出来是一个机场航站楼 - 如此是医院。 机场工作人员都穿衣服（protective）。 看次来他们是医生， 不是机场工作人员。 \n\n让后， 我们一定隔离二十一天在酒店。 下期我会写我隔离的故事。 \n\n--- \n"

I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. \n\nHowever, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons. \n\n\n"
