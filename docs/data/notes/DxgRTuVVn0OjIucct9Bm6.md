### Difference between bù guò, kě shì, dàn shì

These words indicate differences in strength of the meaning:
- bù guò (不过) - 30%
- kě shì （可是）- 50%
- dàn shì (但是) - 100%

Example from Ellie - turning down someone for a date. dàn shì is a definite no.

## Thoughts

I was very surprised that I could make it through a 90 minute class that was spoken almost entirely in Mandarin. I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. 

However, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons.
