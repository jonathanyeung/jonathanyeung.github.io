<p>In this journal, I document my journey in trying to learn Chinese for the 2nd time.</p>
<p>Most of the notes will be from my language classes. Some notes are also arranged as references, for example with grammar and useful vocabulary. But in an effort to practice writing, I will also try to write some notes in Chinese about my experiences here in Beijing.</p>
<p>The grammar may be poor and the sentences simple, please bear with me. Starting simple is part of the learning experience; hopefully with time the posts will become more interesting!</p>
<p>谢谢！</p>
