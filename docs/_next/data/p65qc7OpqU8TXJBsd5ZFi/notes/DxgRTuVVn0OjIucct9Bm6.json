I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. </p>\n<p>However, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons. </p>","noteIndex":{"id":"tP0mD90vo9yAk1VHyoVSk","title":"Journey in 中文","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{},"fname":"root","updated":1633192679985,"created":1632988446599,"parent":null,"children":["H9qDzxUwhOmeT4zlcaKbf","VGTsTXhrREuYjcjspAW6g","X9i6HckFgvkUQ0jaz25Gj","tSyiuG6PVRvuDxGxvYhxA","YXK3064rlQB4yQa8iOpYT"],"data":{},"contentHash":"c115f61742eba4eb575e0b4166d6a0c6","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\nIn this journal, I document my journey in trying to learn Chinese for the 2nd time.\n\nMost of the notes will be from my language classes.
