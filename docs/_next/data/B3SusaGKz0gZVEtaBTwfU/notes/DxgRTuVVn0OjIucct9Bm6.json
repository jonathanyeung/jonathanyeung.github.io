I think it'll be a good thing that my teacher Ellie actually cannot speak that much English.  The one thing that I need to be conscious of is that I make sure to ask questions if I don't fully understand something instead of just partially understanding. This is off to a good start. </p>\n<p>However, I need to remember that the onus is still all on me to learn. I need to do daily homework and practice; I cannot just rely on the lessons. </p>","noteIndex":{"id":"tP0mD90vo9yAk1VHyoVSk","title":"Journey in 中文","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{},"fname":"root","updated":1632992369397,"created":1632988446599,"parent":null,"children":["H9qDzxUwhOmeT4zlcaKbf","X9i6HckFgvkUQ0jaz25Gj","YXK3064rlQB4yQa8iOpYT"],"data":{},"contentHash":"2842e8e1d9fe24c86d5884e925f8c584","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\nIn this blog, I'll document my journey in trying to learn Chinese for the 2nd (3rd?) time.\n\nMost of the notes will be from my classes, but in an effort to practice writing, I will also try to write some notes in Chinese about my experiences here in Beijing.\n\nThe grammar may be bad and the sentences simple - bear with me; but that's part of the learning experience!\n\n谢谢"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":1,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"noAutoCreateOnDefinition":true,"noLegacyNoteRef":true,"noXVaultWikiLink":true,"lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate":false,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"autoFoldFrontmatter":true,"usePrettyRefs":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"lookup":{"note":{"selectionType":"selectionExtract"}},"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain","firstDayOfWeek":1},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"site":{"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Jonathan's 中文 Journal","description":"My Journal for Learning Mandarin","siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"siteUrl":"https://jonathanyeung.github.io/","dest":"/Users/jyeung/code/personal-blog/.next","includeBody":true,"usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"initializeRemoteVaults":true}},"__N_SSG":true}
