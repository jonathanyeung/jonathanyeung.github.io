I joined them a few times over the past couple of weeks. It's been over 3 years since I've actually played - it's been by far the longest period without playing since I first started playing as a little kid. I've had to take time off after a double ACL surgery. </p>\n<p>I've forgotten how much I love playing soccer. Of course my touch was abysmal and my whole body was sore the day after, but it was a big relief to be back on the field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pīnyīn\">pīnyīn<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#pīnyīn\"></a></h2>\n<p>Wǒ de péngyǒu jièshào gěi wǒ yīgè tī qiú de tóngshì.

He organizes a football team to go to Chaoyang every week. I played with them in the last few weeks. Because I had two surgical operations on my knee, I haven't kicked it in three years. In fact, this is the longest time I haven't played since I was a kid.</p>\n<p>I remember I like playing football very much. <strong>Although I was scumbag and my feet and legs hurt after the kick, I am very happy to have the opportunity to play again.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"vocabulary\">Vocabulary<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#vocabulary\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>膝盖 xīgài - knee</li>\n<li>外科手术 - surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/t99a4dbwmptzzvs4hem52ab\">Soccer</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"tP0mD90vo9yAk1VHyoVSk","title":"Journey in 中文","desc":"","updated":1633192679985,"created":1632988446599,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"e1df6c5df8b29a0b6547a656d6502b4e","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["VGTsTXhrREuYjcjspAW6g","X9i6HckFgvkUQ0jaz25Gj","iUTqRrhiYl7NrwSzGbeTw","H9qDzxUwhOmeT4zlcaKbf","tSyiuG6PVRvuDxGxvYhxA","YXK3064rlQB4yQa8iOpYT","bxcd0mfv90vkw29jhe56k7q","j8d8u7cnd8bukg2fwl4kxno"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nIn this journal, I document my journey in trying to learn Chinese for the 2nd time.\n\nMost of the notes will be from my language classes.
