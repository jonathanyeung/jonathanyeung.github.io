Fortunately, I passed - but not without a sweat.</p>\n<p>I had applied for a Chinese driver's license a few weeks ago. Because I had a foreign driver's license, I could skip a driver's test and obtain a license with just a written exam. About a week before my exam, my girlfriend sent me an official app for exam preparation.  But remembering how easy the written driving exam was in America, I casually dismissed it, thinking it should be the same difficulty.</p>\n<p>The evening before the exam, I downloaded the app. As I read about the actual exam, I learned that the exam takes 100 questions randomly out of a thousand question pool, and that one must answer ninety percent correctly to pass!</p>\n<p>I started to go through the questions in the app, but by question 50, I was scoring around 60 percent.  I also hit a paywall and had to buy the full app to see the remaining 950 questions.  While more than half of the questions were intuitive, a lot of questions required memorization - either because of poor translations or nuanced traffic rules such as hand signals and penalties for violations.  I immediately bought the app and started to study non-stop to try to get through all of the questions.</p>\n<p>The day of the exam, I was feeling relatively confident as I had been able to study all 1000 questions. The exam was administered on a computer, with maybe 20 other people also taking the exam in the same session.  I finished the exam with confidence, and I clicked the submission button. A message popped up on the screen in Chinese that I couldn't read, so I walked to the front of the room to talk to the proctor, as several others had already done. However, the proctor indicated that there was a problem, and told me to go back to my computer.  I couldn't understand what she was trying to tell me, so my immediate thought was that I had failed and that I should check my answers and resubmit (I had read online that on a given test day, you get two attempts to pass). I started to panic and began reviewing my answers.  However, I sought to clarify with the proctor what the issue was, and after some difficult conversations in broken Chinese, I understood that there was actually a problem with the system and she was telling me to wait a while before resubmitting the exam. </p>\n<p>Finally, after most of the other exam takers had already finished and left the room, the submission attempt succeeded on the fifth try.  The screen showed that I had scored 98% - I passed!  The proctor congratulated me and sent me along to the collection window to finalize the paper work.</p>\n<p>The final 'exam' of the day - I had to provide our home address so that they could send me my license in a few days. If my verbal Chinese is poor, my written Chinese is worse. I wrote down our address along with my information, the officer squinted at it for a bit before nodding and accepting it.  My girlfriend joked that the chance of my license arriving to the right place were slim - but fortunately, it arrived a few days later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pīnyīn\">pīnyīn<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#pīnyīn\"></a></h2>\n<p>Jīntiān wǒ kǎo jiàzhào.
